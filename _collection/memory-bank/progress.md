# Progress — _collection

## Status

Current: memory-bank protocol scaffolded; product agent not started.
Next: copy `_template/` to `ingest-classifier` and start that agent.

## Checklist

- [x] Decide: per-agent banks only; `_collection` holds repo progress
- [x] Decide: first product agent is `ingest-classifier` (files + records)
- [x] Root protocol: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, Cursor rule, Claude rule
- [x] `_collection` memory-bank
- [x] `_template` for new agents
- [ ] `ingest-classifier` (next slice — do not start until this bank is in use)

## Log

### 2026-09-02

- Locked layout: no shared bank; Cursor + Claude + Codex rules at root and on each bank.
- Scaffolded root `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/memory-bank.mdc`, `.claude/rules/memory-bank.md`.
- Created `_collection` bank (`PROTOCOL.md`, `progress.md`, `decisions.md`, `active-context.md`, `plans/`).
- Created `_template` for copying into new agents.
- Did **not** add `ingest-classifier` code in this slice.
